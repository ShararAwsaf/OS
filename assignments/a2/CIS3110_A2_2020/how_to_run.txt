$ indicates a command line prompt. Do not copy it when running the following material.

So in the same folder as all of your .c files to compile run
$ make

If you don't know what make does Google may be friendly (just don't trust everything you read there)

If successful (ie gcc didn't swear at you) you should now have a file name Dispatcher (there may or may not be a file extension)

Try running
$./Dispatcher
and see what happens. It should fail with an appropriate error message

To run it properly use
$./Dispatcher 500 800 < test_inputs/test1.txt
for round robin

or

$./Dispatcher 800 < test_inputs/test1.txt
for shortest time remaining

The above examples use file redirection to avoid having to hand type all of the input by hand.


If you prefer to type the input in by hand run
$./Dispatcher 500 800
for round robin

or

$./Dispatcher 800
for shortest time remaining

In both cases the program will sit their blinking at you waiting for you to type in the input.
