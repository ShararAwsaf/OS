Program Description
****************************************************
Main Program : Creates four doubly linked lists one for storing direction structs to generate a traffic simulation report. The arrivals of cars are printed in order of their processing times. The directions are inserted in ascending sorted manner based on their arrival times. 

A file containing directions of cars their destination and arrival time are provided line by line. A simulation where four doubly lnk list each representing a direction

are filled with car details and are processed based on given parameters of global clock simulation. The outputs are displayed as soon as processing of a car is completed.


Test Program : This tests all the functions in the provided LinkeListAPI.h library. Test cases contain both edge cases and normal cases and provide a pass or a fail feedback upon success or failure.

The functions are checked using the direction struct.

Additional Program  Details
****************************************************
Complie and Run Main Program:

To compile main program give the command "make program" on the command line 

Executable “program” will be created in the bin upon successful compilation.

To run the program go to command line and type "cd bin" to change directory to bin and give the command "./program" to run


Complie and Run Test Program:

To compile main program give the command "make testProgram" on the command line 

Executable “testProgram” will be created in the bin upon successful compilation.
